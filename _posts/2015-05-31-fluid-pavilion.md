<h3>What does structural memory look like?</h3>

<p>An ethereal presence, <i>Fluid Pavilion</i> displays the ability of plastic to be both rigid and organic, with the lightness of a transparent enclosure. Built upon spatial, material, and visual deformations, the pavilion is both clear and hazy, open and closed: as much a window frame as it is a wall.</p>

<p><i>Fluid Pavilion</i> was a collaboration with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hanxi-wang-868908137" target="_blank">Hanxi Wang</a>, with the mentorship of <a href="https://aap.cornell.edu/people/sasa-zivkovic" target="_blank">Sasa Zivkovic</a> and <a href="https://aap.cornell.edu/people/martin-miller" target="_blank">Martin Miller</a>, Cornell University.</p>

<p>In this 1:1 experimental installation, thermoformed PETG sheets were found to acquire a new resting state after deformation. This ‘memory’ meant that each plastic sheet would always flex back to its deformed state. The final installation thus rests in a state of self-adjusting equilibrium.</p>

The final global form houses three structural systems: a large, soft, and occupiable tubular column that expands out and cantilevers at the top,; a thin, rigid column formed by triangulated units; and a series of mobile strips forming an arch between the two.</p>

<h3>Materiality</h3>

			<p>This early experiment with thermoformed plastic captures its transformation, with 'memory' embedded into the material. The flat sheet of plastic has been thermoformed into a curved, wavy surface, and holds this curved shape. When stretched out, it springs back to its wavy shape. </p><p>In exploring PETG plastic as a material, its malleability (plasticity) and elasticity were of great interest to us: under heat, plastic could be shaped freely; after thermoforming, it would retain and even spring back to its shape.</p>

<h3>Design Process</h3>
<p>The entire pavilion is made of three types of units: a rectangle, a trapezium and a square.</p>

<span class="image fit"><img src="{% link assets/images/fluid-pavilion/charisse-foo-fluid-pavilion-12.jpg %}" alt="3 units" /></span>

<p>A rectangle is 1 unit wide, a square is 2 units wide, and a trapezium connects 1 unit to 2 units. </p>
<p>Three-dimensional deformations expected from thermoforming plastic were modelled on top of this planar unit-to-unit aggregation.</p>

<span class="image fit"><img src="{% link assets/images/fluid-pavilion/charisse-foo-fluid-pavilion-13.jpg %}" alt="3 units aggregation with surface deformation" /></span>

<p>In aggregating these three elements, we were interested in creating ‘pinching’ within the entire surface, so as to develop three-dimensional form. This also created varying degrees of structural strength.</p>
<span class="image fit"><img src="{% link assets/images/fluid-pavilion/charisse-foo-fluid-pavilion-14.jpg %}" alt="3 units aggregation" /></span>

<p>These aggregations were modelled digitally and tested in Kangaroo, with a magnetic force causing the pinching between the surfaces. </p>

<p>Of course, we also tested these with physical chipboard models, which were laser-cut and glued together.</p>

<p> Here are some aggregations we explored, in 2D form and their resultant 3D form. </p>

<p>Here is an unfolded diagram of our final pavilion, composed of the same three units.</p>

<h3>Fabrication Process</h3>
<p>Hanxi and I designed our own fabrication process in order to build the entire installation ourselves.</p>

<p>Moulds for the three units were CNC-milled, with a positive and negative mould for each unit, so that the plastic could be pressed in between the two moulds. PETG plastic sheets were cut to size: essentially into 1' squares, since we were working with 4' x 8' plastic sheets. We used an oven (nothing fancy!) to heat up both the mould and the plastic sheet, until the plastic conformed to the shape of the mould.</p>

<span class="image fit"><img src="{% link assets/images/fluid-pavilion/charisse-foo-fluid-pavilion-18.jpg %}" alt="fabrication process" /></span>

<p>Every unit was made in this manner: <ul>
<li>After being removed from the oven, the plastic was sandwiched between the top and bottom moulds.</li><li> Once the plastic had hardened - usually in a matter of seconds - it was removed.</li><li>Extra plastic was trimmed off with a bandsaw.</li><li>Rough edges were sanded with a belt sander.</li><li>Holes were drilled at fixed connection points. The positions of these holes were already drilled in the wooden moulds, so it was simply a matter of lining up the plastic piece and the mould, then drilling with a hand drill. </li></ul>Each unit had a maximum of 12 connection points, allowing for alternating connections between units.</p>

<p>Since much of our building was iterative and experimental, fasteners were used as temporary joints. These were ultimately replaced by rivets when their position was confirmed.</p>
