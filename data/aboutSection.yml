  ### I love making images and telling stories.

  As a professional designer for the last 8 years, I'm drawn to meaningful projects that marry research and design.


  Designing for healthcare has been a great privilege. I deeply value engaging with the 'Big Questions' of life and death, fear and hope, technology and ethics. In the face of complexities and clunkiness, I hope to make a difference with thoughtful and creative problem-solving.
