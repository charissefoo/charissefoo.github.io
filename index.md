<p> Charisse graduated with a Bachelor of Architecture (B. Arch) from Cornell University, where
she was awarded the Charles Goodwin Sands Memorial Medal for excellence in her
undergraduate thesis. She started her career as a CGI designer at <a href="https://dbox.com"> DBOX </a> in New York City
and is now based in Singapore.</p><p>
Charisse is fascinated by the creation of literary and visual worlds, and the potential of fiction
to examine the ethical and the critical realities of architecture. Her recent work explores the
role of time in undermining notions of architectural permanence. She was once described as a
poetic pragmatist, an expression she cherishes to this day.</p>
