  ## Awards & Education

  My formal training in architecture has instilled in me the ability to design at multiple scales, the love of an iterative and rigorous design process, and the ability to communicate ideas clearly and persuasively.  


  It is with gratitude and humility that these projects and pursuits have received awards after being completed, or grants to facilitate their creation.
