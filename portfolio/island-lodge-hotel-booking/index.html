Imagined as a redevelopment of the <a href=https://www.sla.gov.sg/state-land-n-property/management-of-state-land-and-property/visiting-the-sla-managed-islands/st-johns-island>four existing campsites</a> on the island, <em>The Island Lodge</em> offers a <strong>quieter alternative</strong> to the touristic holiday island of Sentosa.</p><h4 id=deliverables>Deliverables</h4><p>High fidelity prototype, high fidelity wireframes, high fidelity annotations (handover documentation).

Please choose the <strong>Dolphin Deluxe Room,</strong> the <strong>Flexible Rate</strong> payment option, and add the <strong>Romance Under The Stars</strong> additional package. Enjoy!</em></p><h3 id=user-flow>User Flow</h3><p>This primary user flow targets <strong>users who have concluded their browsing</strong>: they know the dates and rooms they plan to book. Determining the <strong>screens, screen states, and user actions</strong> involved in a <strong>linear booking process</strong> was a necessary first step before sketching wireframes.</p><figure><img src=/images/portfolio/island-lodge/charisse-foo-island-lodge-hotel-booking-04.jpg width=100%></figure><p><strong>Browse first, book later:</strong> earlier usability tests revealed that users would first browse through the hotel website before committing to making a hotel booking. While browsing, they explored the different types of rooms and amenities, <strong>without bothering to enter any planned dates</strong> for travel. To smoothly <strong>connect the browsing and booking processes</strong>, it was important to enable <strong>room selection before date selection</strong> as a secondary user flow.</p><figure><img src=/images/portfolio/island-lodge/charisse-foo-island-lodge-hotel-booking-05.jpg width=100%></figure><p>Of course, both user flows merge at the end, and can transition into each other if the selected rooms or dates are not available.</p><h3 id=wireframe-sketches>Wireframe Sketches</h3><p>These sketches were a first stab at designing screens based on the primary user flows.</p><figure><img src=/images/portfolio/island-lodge/charisse-foo-island-lodge-hotel-booking-06.jpg width=100%></figure><h3 id=medium-fidelity-prototypes>Medium-Fidelity Prototypes</h3><h4 id=initial-wireframes>Initial Wireframes</h4><p>I then designed a medium-fidelity prototype for <strong>user testing</strong>. These initial wireframes focused on <strong>key interactions</strong> within the primary user flow, as well as <strong>layout and visual hierarchy</strong>.</p><figure><img src=/images/portfolio/island-lodge/charisse-foo-island-lodge-hotel-booking-08.jpg width=100%></figure><h4 id=usability-testing>Usability Testing</h4><p>Early user testing revealed that <strong>visual content was key</strong>: actual images made it a lot easier for users to interact with the prototype and understand the content that was on the site. All images used are freely usable and obtained from <a href=https://unsplash.com/>Unsplash</a> or <a href=https://www.pexels.com/>Pexels</a>.</p><p>User feedback was extremely helpful in highlighting places where <strong>layout was confusing</strong>, as well as <strong>digital affordances</strong> that should have been stronger. While I had prioritised the ability to complete the hotel booking as a guest, without the need to sign up or sign in, user testing conveyed the <strong>desirability of a membership portal</strong> for easy retrival and management of their hotel reservations. Hence, I detailed more screens reflecting additional user flows, depending on whether guests sign up for a new account or sign in to their existing account. Testing was also a useful reminder of the need for <strong>large tap targets</strong> on mobile, and a source of many refinements to content and copy.</p><h4 id=design-iterations>Design Iterations</h4><figure><img src=/images/portfolio/island-lodge/charisse-foo-island-lodge-hotel-booking-11.png width=100%></figure><p><strong>Problem:</strong> A user was confused as to whether the price and photo applied to the room above or the room below.<br><strong>Response:</strong> The price is now displayed after the room name, as the user expected. Clicking anywhere in the room title area will bring the user to the individual room page.</p><p><strong>Problem:</strong> It did not make sense to allow a &lsquo;0 Adult&rsquo; or &lsquo;0 Room&rsquo; booking.<br><strong>Response:</strong> When the number of guests or rooms is at a minimum of 1, the &lsquo;-&rsquo; button disappears.</p><figure><img src=/images/portfolio/island-lodge/charisse-foo-island-lodge-hotel-booking-12.png width=100%></figure><p><strong>Problem:</strong> Users were equally interested in the &lsquo;Sign In&rsquo; or &lsquo;Sign Up&rsquo; options as they were in the &lsquo;Continue as Guest&rsquo; one. Not all requests need follow-up.<br><strong>Response:</strong> Buttons were standardised in size and alignment, allowing for greater visual consistency. The line about necessary follow-up was removed.</p><p><strong>Problem:</strong> Making the &lsquo;Sign In&rsquo; screen an overlay over the previous screen increased visual clutter. There was potential confusion regarding the grayed-out back button.<br><strong>Response:</strong> The &lsquo;Sign In&rsquo; screen is its own screen, and the page title and back button are consistent across all screens.</p><figure><img src=/images/portfolio/island-lodge/charisse-foo-island-lodge-hotel-booking-13.png width=100%></figure><p><strong>Problem:</strong> A summary of the booking details should be presented legibly, with details such as a price breakdown and reservation number.<br><strong>Response:</strong> More information was added and differentiated through visual hierarchy.</p><h4 id=improved-wireframes>Improved Wireframes</h4><figure><img src=/images/portfolio/island-lodge/charisse-foo-island-lodge-hotel-booking-09.jpg width=100%></figure><h3 id=visual-design>Visual Design</h3><figure><img src=/images/portfolio/island-lodge/charisse-foo-island-lodge-hotel-booking-14.jpg width=100%></figure><p><strong>Mood images</strong> provided inspiration for the visual design. Since <em>The Island Lodge</em> is a high-end beach resort, I went for <strong>warm earthy tones,</strong> a primarily <strong>dark, muted palette</strong>, and serif headings to convey a sense of <strong>timeless tropical luxury.</strong></p><p>In this style guide for typography and colour, the dark primary green evokes <strong>lush tropical vegetation</strong>. The light colours are used for pages with <strong>specific microtasks</strong>, such as date selection, before the user returns to the darker <strong>&lsquo;home&rsquo; colour palette.</strong></p><figure><img src=/images/portfolio/island-lodge/charisse-foo-island-lodge-hotel-booking-15.jpg width=100%></figure><p>Knowing that yellow and green are a common set of confusion colours when it comes to colour blindness, I <a href=https://davidmathlogic.com/colorblind>tested</a> the colour scheme for <strong>accessibility to people with colour blindness</strong> and made adjustments.<figure><img src=/images/portfolio/island-lodge/charisse-foo-island-lodge-hotel-booking-16.jpg width=100%></figure></p><h3 id=high-fidelity-prototype>High Fidelity Prototype</h3><figure><img src=/images/portfolio/island-lodge/charisse-foo-island-lodge-hotel-booking-10.jpg width=100%></figure><p>These wirefames are the basis for the high fidelity prototype shown at the start. Besides improvements to copy and content, I designed additional screens to facilitate the <strong>secondary user flow</strong> where room selection occurs before date selection. Designs for <strong>error states</strong> are also included.</p><h4 id=design-iterations-1>Design Iterations</h4><figure><img src=/images/portfolio/island-lodge/charisse-foo-island-lodge-hotel-booking-17.png width=100%></figure><p>As <strong>price transparency is very important to users</strong>, and there is a lot of information presented, I expanded the price breakdown screen from a modal dropdown to a separate page.</p><figure><img src=/images/portfolio/island-lodge/charisse-foo-island-lodge-hotel-booking-18.png width=100%></figure><p>Similarly, I split the final success screen into two, to properly <strong>congratulate</strong> the user for completing the booking process with a splash image, and give the <strong>all-important booking details sufficient space</strong> on a separate page. The &lsquo;Back to Home&rsquo; button was also replaced with <strong>more useful functions</strong> of <strong>editing</strong> the reservation or <strong>sharing</strong> the trip with friends and family.</p><h3 id=design-annotations>Design Annotations</h3><figure><img src=/images/portfolio/island-lodge/charisse-foo-island-lodge-hotel-booking-19.jpg width=100%></figure><p>To wrap up the design process, I produced these design annotations as <strong>handover documentation</strong> for developers to build the website accurately. The full 18-page document can be found <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZkRj5t5BSqYcLx8gPDEsAxVvdqbTjg45/view?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p><h3 id=design-feedback>Design Feedback</h3><p>&ldquo;The prototype functions very well, it was easy to get through, easy to understand and very pleasant to look at.&rdquo;</p><h3 id=further-exploration>Further Exploration</h3><h4 id=next-steps>Next Steps</h4><p>As this was an academic project, a significant next step would be to <strong>integrate real-world hotel information</strong>, which often has a much higher level of complexity: many more details regarding payment, hotel policies, terms and conditions, health and security regulations, just to name a few. Working with a client with an existing repository of information to be presented would add complexity to the design process.</p><p>Since I chose to focus on a mobile website, a separate <strong>desktop version</strong> would also have to be designed. I&rsquo;d also sketched out a <strong>comparison feature</strong> for different payment options if the hotel absolutely needed to offer many different options.</p><p>To further expand the scope of this project, I&rsquo;d integrate this particular hotel into a <strong>larger hotel group</strong>, which manages several hotels across different locations. This is often the case with large hotel brands such as Four Seasons or Shangri-La. Each hotel would have its own identity, but be linked to the larger brand ecosystem. I&rsquo;d expect this to make the booking process more exploratory and complex, with greater importance placed on <strong>brand loyalty and membership privileges.</strong></p><h4 id=learning-points>Learning Points</h4><p>Going through <strong>the entire UX process from research to analysis to design</strong> was highly enriching and educational. I especially appreciated the insights gained through usability testing - <strong>nothing challenges or validates a design as much as seeing someone completely unfamiliar with it interact with it for the first time.</strong></p><p>Technically, I <strong>thoroughly enjoyed learning Figma</strong> from scratch through this project. I&rsquo;d like to delve deeper into user interface design with grid systems for screens that are <strong>pixel-perfect</strong>, and visual design by developing a <strong>strong brand identity.</strong></p></div></div></div></div><div class=singleBlog__content><div class="row mt-5"><div class="col-lg-10 offset-lg-1"><nav class="case-details-nav d-flex justify-content-between align-items-center"><div class="previous d-flex align-items-center"><div class="icon mr-3"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15.556" height="28.285" viewBox="0 0 15.556 28.285"><g data-name="Group 1243" fill="#2d2d2d"><path data-name="Path 1456" d="M3.391 12.728l9.75 14.142-.982 1.414-9.742-14.142z"/><path data-name="Path 1455" d="M13.137 1.41 3.39 15.558l-.975-1.415L12.166.0z"/></g></svg></div><div class=content><span class=small>Previous Project</span><h5 class=title><a class=text-dark href=https://charissefoo.github.io/portfolio/island-lodge-research/>The Island Lodge Research</a></h5></div></div></nav></div></div></div></section></div><section class=footer><div class=container><div class="row footer__footer"><div class=col-lg-6><div class="footer__footer_copy text-light"><p>If you made it this far, <a href=https://charissefoo.github.io/contact>let's talk.</a></p></div><div class=footer__footer_copy><p>© Charisse Foo</p></div></div><div class=col-lg-6><div class=footer__footer_social><ul class=unstyle-list><li class="d-inline-block mx-2"><a class=text-light target=_blank href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/charissefoo><i class="fa fa-linkedin-square"></i></a></li><li class="d-inline-block mx-2"><a class=text-light target=_blank href=https://www.behance.net/charissefoo><i class="fa fa-behance-square"></i></a></li><li class="d-inline-block mx-2"><a class=text-light target=_blank href=https://instagram.com/charissefoo><i class="fa fa-instagram"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></section><script src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=YOUR%20GOOGLE%20MAP%20API&libraries=geometry"></script>
