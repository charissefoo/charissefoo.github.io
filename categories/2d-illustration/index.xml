&lt;p>&lt;em>AHA! (Augmented Heritage Adventure)&lt;/em> revives the famed Qing Dynasty work of Zichuan-born writer Pu Songling: &lt;strong>&lt;em>Liaozhai Zhiyi&lt;/em> (聊斋志异), known in English as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strange_Stories_from_a_Chinese_Studio">&lt;em>Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio&lt;/em>&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>. Pu Songling’s residence in Zichuan has been preserved as a tourist attraction, and now his five hundred fantastic tales find new life in a &lt;strong>gamified augmented reality adventure.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Oasis Waterpark</title><link>https://charissefoo.github.io/blog/oasis-waterpark/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://charissefoo.github.io/blog/oasis-waterpark/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="oasis-waterpark-explores-architectural-memory-through-comics">Oasis Waterpark explores architectural memory through comics.&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>An illustrated journey through time and space, &lt;em>Oasis Waterpark&lt;/em> tells of shared memories housed within one public playground. Each moment – joyful, familiar, comforting, playful, or poignant – is framed in a multi-panel comic, charting a narrative that contains the past, present, and future in the same place. This illustration pays homage to &lt;a href="https://theperiodicfable.wordpress.com/comics-index-of-multi-panel-pans-by-decade/1930s-multi-panel-pans/">Frank King&amp;rsquo;s multi-panel comics of the 1930s&lt;/a>, exploring the notion of place, imbued with meaning and memory, through the stories it contains: the structures in which we lose and find ourselves.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Art of Memory</title><link>https://charissefoo.github.io/blog/the-art-of-memory/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://charissefoo.github.io/blog/the-art-of-memory/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="overview">Overview&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Historic preservation is often a dry topic, with a large focus on regulations and conservation. Here, we take an experimental approach towards preservation, investigating architectural memory through travel, documentation, and speculative drawings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>The Art of Memory&lt;/em> was a collaboration with &lt;a href="https://yichenjia.github.io/">Yichen Jia&lt;/a>, made possible by the &lt;a href="https://aap.cornell.edu/academics/architecture/about/fellowships">2018-2019 Robert James Eidlitz Travel Fellowship&lt;/a>. It was exhibited in
&lt;a href="https://aap.cornell.edu/news-events/charisse-foo-and-yichen-jia-art-memory">NYC&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://libraries.mit.edu/exhibits/exhibit/memory/">MIT&lt;/a>, and published in &lt;a href="https://www.blurb.com/b/9919013-the-art-of-memory">book&lt;/a> form.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Sited in four Italian towns that have been indelibly changed by natural disasters, this project explores the notion of architectural memory. Across Pompeii, Catania, Poggioreale, and Gibellina, each town embodies a unique approach towards destruction and preservation.
The ‘perfectly’ preserved ruins of Pompeii are set against the bustling capital of Catania, the ghost town of Poggioreale, and the crumbling modernist art installations of Gibellina.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
