hello this is my first post in text

the 10 commands

1. open powershell
2. type 'hugo server' (add -D to enable drafts)
3. refer to https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/

how to preserve my history
go to existing site folder, delete everything except all the things that start with .git
make a commit. this will save a snapshot with an empty site
then do hugo new site and copy all the new site folders into the github folder. then make a commit.

need to figure out how to make jekyll convert the entire site to html. it will produce a folder of html files.
copy the folder into the hugo site.

themes
download theme from github and put it in this folder, and then make a commit
\Hugo\Sites\mysite\themes
