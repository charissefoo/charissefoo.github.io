&lt;p>&lt;em>AHA! (Augmented Heritage Adventure)&lt;/em> revives the famed Qing Dynasty work of Zichuan-born writer Pu Songling: &lt;strong>&lt;em>Liaozhai Zhiyi&lt;/em> (聊斋志异), known in English as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strange_Stories_from_a_Chinese_Studio">&lt;em>Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio&lt;/em>&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>. Pu Songling’s residence in Zichuan has been preserved as a tourist attraction, and now his five hundred fantastic tales find new life in a &lt;strong>gamified augmented reality adventure.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Art of Memory</title><link>https://charissefoo.github.io/blog/the-art-of-memory/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://charissefoo.github.io/blog/the-art-of-memory/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="overview">Overview&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Historic preservation is often a dry topic, with a large focus on regulations and conservation. Here, we take an experimental approach towards preservation, investigating architectural memory through travel, documentation, and speculative drawings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>The Art of Memory&lt;/em> was a collaboration with &lt;a href="https://yichenjia.github.io/">Yichen Jia&lt;/a>, made possible by the &lt;a href="https://aap.cornell.edu/academics/architecture/about/fellowships">2018-2019 Robert James Eidlitz Travel Fellowship&lt;/a>. It was exhibited in
&lt;a href="https://aap.cornell.edu/news-events/charisse-foo-and-yichen-jia-art-memory">NYC&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://libraries.mit.edu/exhibits/exhibit/memory/">MIT&lt;/a>, and published in &lt;a href="https://www.blurb.com/b/9919013-the-art-of-memory">book&lt;/a> form.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Sited in four Italian towns that have been indelibly changed by natural disasters, this project explores the notion of architectural memory. Across Pompeii, Catania, Poggioreale, and Gibellina, each town embodies a unique approach towards destruction and preservation.
The ‘perfectly’ preserved ruins of Pompeii are set against the bustling capital of Catania, the ghost town of Poggioreale, and the crumbling modernist art installations of Gibellina.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Fluid Pavilion</title><link>https://charissefoo.github.io/blog/fluid-pavilion/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 May 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://charissefoo.github.io/blog/fluid-pavilion/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="what-does-structural-memory-look-like">What does structural memory look like?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>An ethereal presence, &lt;em>Fluid Pavilion&lt;/em> displays the ability of plastic to be both rigid and organic, with the lightness of a transparent enclosure. Built upon spatial, material, and visual deformations, the pavilion is both clear and hazy, open and closed: as much a window frame as it is a wall.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Fluid Pavilion&lt;/em> was a collaboration with &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hanxi-wang-868908137">Hanxi Wang&lt;/a>, with the mentorship of &lt;a href="https://aap.cornell.edu/people/sasa-zivkovic">Sasa Zivkovic&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://aap.cornell.edu/people/martin-miller">Martin Miller&lt;/a>, Cornell University.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
