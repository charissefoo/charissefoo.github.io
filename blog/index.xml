In recent years, conversations with my junior college art teacher about art education and the role of technology in art-making led to some realisations:
3D software is largely absent from the art curriculum. Teachers aren&amp;rsquo;t really familiar with 3D software or what it can do. Some students pick up Blender by themselves and make artwork despite a steep learning curve.</description></item><item><title>Designing A Pianist's Website</title><link>https://charissefoo.github.io/blog/pianist-website/</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://charissefoo.github.io/blog/pianist-website/</guid><description>Overview Clarisse, a classical pianist, was looking for ways to increase her online presence. I designed a website for her to consolidate her musical material in one place, and to establish her personal brand.
Context Two barriers had kept Clarisse from making a website: technical knowhow and cost. She didn&amp;rsquo;t code, and she was hesitant about committing to a hefty paid subscription.
I priotized solutions that involved minimal cost, to get her website up and running as soon as possible, and for it to remain a sustainable long-term solution.</description></item><item><title>Tyflow Experiments</title><link>https://charissefoo.github.io/blog/tyflow-experiments/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://charissefoo.github.io/blog/tyflow-experiments/</guid><description>Experiments with 3D Physics and Particle Simulations I&amp;rsquo;d used 3DS Max professionally every day for a couple of years, but still barely scratched the surface of what it could do.
These experiments with Tyflow are by-products of deepening my technical and artistic skills, by learning more about 3D particle systems, physics simulations, and animation. I enrolled in the Tyflow Basecamp in 2020 and thoroughly enjoyed learning and making these.</description></item><item><title>Augmented Heritage Adventure (AHA!)</title><link>https://charissefoo.github.io/blog/augmented-heritage-adventure/</link><pubDate>Sat, 31 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://charissefoo.github.io/blog/augmented-heritage-adventure/</guid><description>Magical stories of talking animals, immortals, demons, and deities come to life through augmented reality. AHA! (Augmented Heritage Adventure) revives the famed Qing Dynasty work of Zichuan-born writer Pu Songling: Liaozhai Zhiyi (聊斋志异), known in English as Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio. Pu Songling’s residence in Zichuan has been preserved as a tourist attraction, and now his five hundred fantastic tales find new life in a gamified augmented reality adventure.</description></item><item><title>Oasis Waterpark</title><link>https://charissefoo.github.io/blog/oasis-waterpark/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://charissefoo.github.io/blog/oasis-waterpark/</guid><description>Oasis Waterpark explores architectural memory through comics. An illustrated journey through time and space, Oasis Waterpark tells of shared memories housed within one public playground. Each moment – joyful, familiar, comforting, playful, or poignant – is framed in a multi-panel comic, charting a narrative that contains the past, present, and future in the same place. This illustration pays homage to Frank King&amp;rsquo;s multi-panel comics of the 1930s, exploring the notion of place, imbued with meaning and memory, through the stories it contains: the structures in which we lose and find ourselves.</description></item><item><title>Satellite Town</title><link>https://charissefoo.github.io/blog/satellite-town/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://charissefoo.github.io/blog/satellite-town/</guid><description>Satellite Town illustrates a future of ecological living beyond the limits of the Earth. In a research community living in a satellite orbiting the Moon, distinct notions of self-sufficiency and sustainability are explored, each with a distinct color palette. The Forest depicts the distinctive pink glow of high intensity LEDs for crop growth; The Street imagines an underpass with bioluminescent mycelium pavements that generate electricity from footsteps; The Chapel depicts a zero-gravity projection room featuring an endless sunset against distant planets.</description></item><item><title>The Monument to the Labors</title><link>https://charissefoo.github.io/blog/the-monument-to-the-labors/</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 May 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://charissefoo.github.io/blog/the-monument-to-the-labors/</guid><description>The Monument to the Labors tells an architectural fable in outer space. Narrated dispassionately, The Monument to the Labors imagines a future that has already been translated into history. In this recasting of the pioneer narrative, the first settlers of space are not merely brave explorers but also condemned convicts. Centering around alienation and the implications of denying humanity to the other, the story simultaneously charts the lifespan of a building: a satellite, prison, laboratory, factory, town, tomb, billboard, attraction, and symbol.</description></item><item><title>Fluid Pavilion</title><link>https://charissefoo.github.io/blog/fluid-pavilion/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 May 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://charissefoo.github.io/blog/fluid-pavilion/</guid><description>What does structural memory look like? An ethereal presence, Fluid Pavilion displays the ability of plastic to be both rigid and organic, with the lightness of a transparent enclosure. Built upon spatial, material, and visual deformations, the pavilion is both clear and hazy, open and closed: as much a window frame as it is a wall.
Fluid Pavilion was a collaboration with Hanxi Wang, with the mentorship of Sasa Zivkovic and Martin Miller, Cornell University.</description></item></channel></rss>
