  ### I love making images and telling stories.

  From mobile games to comics, from a travel fellowship to 3D physics simulations, I am drawn to work that is deeply poetic yet practical.  


  For the last 4 years, I’ve been building 3D worlds and images within the architectural industry. I’m fascinated by the interplay between the technologically constructed image and physical reality, and the potential of fiction to examine the ethical and critical realities of society.
