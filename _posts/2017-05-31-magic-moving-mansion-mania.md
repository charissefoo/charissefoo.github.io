### Anastasia is lost in a magical mansion where the rooms move in mysterious ways.

Help guide her to safety, but donâ€™t let her fall into nothingness!

_Magic Moving Mansion Mania_ is a mobile action-puzzle platformer where the player rearranges rooms of a house to guide its protagonist to safety. It aims to evoke a sense of wonder and playful whimsicality as Anastasia, a young child, explores a magical indoor world.

_Magic Moving Mansion Mania_ was **awarded the [Best Student Game](http://www.cis.cornell.edu/cis-team-wins-best-student-game-games-festival) at the 2017 Boston Festival of Indie Games,** and the **[Most Polished Game](http://gdiac.cs.cornell.edu/news/index.php?id=24) and 2nd Place Audience Choice at the 2017 GDIAC Showcase.**

### Boston Festival of Indie Games

It was a privilege to be part of the 2017 [Boston Festival of Indie Games](https://www.bostonfig.com/), and an even greater one to be awarded the Best Student Game at the festival. Meeting so many other indie game developers and designers was a real inspiration.

### Art Assets

Yichen and I worked on character and environment art, UI/UX design, and promotional material.

<span class="image fit"><img src="{% link /assets/images/magic-moving-mansion-mania/charisse-foo-magic-moving-mansion-mania-28.jpg %}" alt="" /></span>

The environment was colour-coded from the start, with different layers of the mansion being clearly differentiated by colour. This stayed consistent as we added more interactive and decorative elements.

### Process

Our first prototype was a test of gameplay mechanics with cardboard tiles that could be physically moved around. The experience from this playtesting was significant in highlighting the importance of the game's UI, so players could understand how they were switching tiles. It also highlighted mechanics and interactions that we had to clarify within the team, such as:

- Is the side of the phone screen a wall? (Decision: No)
- Does the character automatically enter every door? (Decision: Yes)
- Should players be able to tap to open or close doors? (Decision: No)
- Can the character survive a fall? (Decision: No)

			<span class="image fit"><img src="{% link assets/images/magic-moving-mansion-mania/charisse-foo-magic-moving-mansion-mania-11.jpg %}" alt="" /></span>
	</div>
</div>

User testing and feedback were important for us in learning what frustrated players - not understanding how locked tiles worked, for example - and how to improve. As Anastasia continuously walks forward, gameplay is fast-paced, and puzzles are designed to be challenging and fun. This sometimes resulted in players feeling stressed, while, at other times, players felt impatient at having to wait for the character to walk forward when they had already planned out her path. This feedback resulted in the implementation of the speed-up button to increase Anastasia's walking speed for players who were already comfortable with the game.

<p>Enthusiastic reviews about the final version suggest at least some success in creating a fun puzzle game.</p>
