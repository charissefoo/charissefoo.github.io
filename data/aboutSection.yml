  ### I love making images and telling stories.

  From mobile games to comics, from a travel fellowship, exhibition, and publication to hand sketches and 3D physics simulations, I strive to produce work that is deeply poetic yet practical.  


  For the last 4 years, I’ve been building 3D worlds and images within the architectural industry. I’m fascinated by the interplay between the technologically constructed image and physical reality, and the potential of fiction to examine the ethical and the critical realities of society.
