<h3><i>Oasis Waterpark</i> explores architectural memory through comics.</h3>

<p> An illustrated journey through time and space, <i> Oasis Waterpark </i> tells of shared memories housed within one public playground. Each moment – joyful, familiar, comforting, playful, or poignant – is framed in a multi-panel comic, charting a narrative that contains the past, present, and future in the same place. This illustration pays homage to Frank King's multi-panel comics of the 1930s, exploring the notion of place, imbued with meaning and memory, through the stories it contains: the structures in which we lose and find ourselves. </p>
