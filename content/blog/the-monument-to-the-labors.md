### _The Monument to the Labors_ tells an architectural fable in outer space.

{{<rawhtml>}}

<p> Narrated dispassionately, <i> The Monument to the Labors </i> imagines a future that has already been translated into history. In this recasting of the pioneer narrative, the first settlers of space are not merely brave explorers but also condemned convicts. Centering around alienation and the implications of denying humanity to the other, the story simultaneously charts the lifespan of a building: a satellite, prison, laboratory, factory, town, tomb, billboard, attraction, and symbol. These two narratives tie the privilege of dreaming to the costs of experimentation. The utopian possibilities of outer space, the great unknown, are not only the fantasies of the privileged, but also the desperate hope of the marginalized. </p>

<strong> Consisting of five images and a 1,400-word story, <i> The Monument to the Labors </i>  was awarded First Place at the <a href="https://www.archdaily.com/924961/outer-space-2019-winners-announced">Outer Space 2019</a> competition, organized by <a href="https://blankspaceproject.com/"> BlankSpaceNYC.</a> It was subsequently featured in the exhibition <i> Architecture at the Edge of Everything Else </i> at Cornell University, Fall 2019.</strong>
