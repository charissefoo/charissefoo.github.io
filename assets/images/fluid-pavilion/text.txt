What does structural memory look like? 

In this 1:1 experimental installation, PETG sheets were found to acquire a new resting state after deformation, and to always flex back to this deformed state. This ‘stretchy-ness’ acted as pre-tension and allowed the final installation to rest in a state of self-adjusting equilibrium. 

Built upon spatial, material, and visual deformations, the pavilion is both rigid and organic, clear and hazy, open and closed: as much a window frame as it is a wall.
