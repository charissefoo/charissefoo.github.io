### Oasis Waterpark explores architectural memory through comics.

An illustrated journey through time and space, _Oasis Waterpark_ tells of shared memories housed within one public playground. Each moment – joyful, familiar, comforting, playful, or poignant – is framed in a multi-panel comic, charting a narrative that contains the past, present, and future in the same place. This illustration pays homage to [Frank King's multi-panel comics of the 1930s](https://theperiodicfable.wordpress.com/comics-index-of-multi-panel-pans-by-decade/1930s-multi-panel-pans/), exploring the notion of place, imbued with meaning and memory, through the stories it contains: the structures in which we lose and find ourselves.

**_Oasis Waterpark_ was awarded [Second Prize](https://www.facebook.com/playpointasia/posts/3238293216230176) at the #sketchourplayground challenge, organized by [Playpoint Asia](https://playpoint.asia/), and featured as the cover image for Playpoint's 2021 notebook.**
