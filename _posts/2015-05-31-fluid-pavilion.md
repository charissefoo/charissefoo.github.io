<h3>What does structural memory look like?</h3>

<p>An ethereal presence, <i>Fluid Pavilion</i> displays the ability of plastic to be both rigid and organic, as well as the lightness of a transparent enclosure. Built upon spatial, material, and visual deformations, the pavilion is both rigid and organic, clear and hazy, open and closed: as much a window frame as it is a wall.</p>

<p>In this 1:1 experimental installation, thermoformed PETG sheets were found to acquire a new resting state after deformation. This ‘memory’ meant that each plastic sheet would always flex back to its three-dimensionally deformed state. The final installation thus rests in a state of self-adjusting equilibrium, as the ‘stretchy-ness’ of the thermoformed plastic acts as pre-tension.</p>

<h3>Materiality</h3>

			<p>This early experiment with thermoformed plastic captures its transformation, with 'memory' embedded into the material. The flat sheet of plastic has been thermoformed into a curved, wavy surface, and holds this curved shape. When stretched out, it springs back to its wavy shape. In exploring PETG plastic as a material, its malleability (plasticity) and elasticity were of great interest to us: under heat, plastic could be shaped freely; after thermoforming, it would retain and even spring back to its shape.</p>

<h3>Design Process</h3>
<p>The entire pavilion is made of three types of units: a rectangle, a trapezium and a square.</p>

<span class="image fit"><img src="{% link assets/images/fluid-pavilion/charisse-foo-fluid-pavilion-12.jpg %}" alt="3 units" /></span>

<p>A rectangle is 1 unit wide, a square is 2 units wide, and a trapezium connects 1 unit to 2 units. In aggregating these three elements, we were interested in creating ‘pinching’ within the entire surface, so as to develop three-dimensional form. This also created varying degrees of structural strength.</p>
<p>Three-dimensional deformations expected from thermoforming plastic were modelled on top of this planar unit-to-unit aggregation.</p>

<p>These aggregations were modelled digitally and tested in Kangaroo, with a magnetic force causing the pinching between the surfaces. </p>

<p>Of course, we also tested these with physical chipboard models, which were laser-cut and glued together.</p>

<p> Here are some aggregations we explored, in 2D form and their resultant 3D form. </p>

<h3>Fabrication Process</h3>
<p>We designed our own fabrication process in order to build the entire installation ourselves. As much of the unit geometry and connections as possible was built into the CNC-milled molds. </p>

As 1:1 material properties could not be entirely modelled digitally or in study models, aggregating the actual units was a continual process of experimentation and testing.

Each unit had a maximum of 12 connection points, with positions embedded in the molds, allowing for alternating connections between units. The specifics of the final form evolved from this iterative building, where the installation was as much a test of material properties as a spatial intervention.

The final global form houses three structural systems: 1) a thin, rigid column formed by triangulated units, 2) a large, soft, and occupiable tubular column that expands out and cantilevers at the top, and 3) a series of mobile strips forming an arch between the two.
