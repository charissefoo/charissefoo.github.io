### What does it mean to remember?

Sited in four Italian towns that have been indelibly changed by natural disasters, this project explores the notion of architectural memory. Across Pompeii, Catania, Poggioreale, and Gibellina, each town embodies a unique approach towards destruction and preservation.
The ‘perfectly’ preserved ruins of Pompeii are set against the bustling capital of Catania, the ghost town of Poggioreale, and the crumbling modernist art installations of Gibellina.

The Art of Memory was a collaboration with [Yichen Jia](https://yichenjia.github.io/), made possible by the [2018-2019 Robert James Eidlitz Travel Fellowship](https://aap.cornell.edu/academics/architecture/about/fellowships). It was exhibited in
[NYC](https://aap.cornell.edu/news-events/charisse-foo-and-yichen-jia-art-memory) and [MIT](https://libraries.mit.edu/exhibits/exhibit/memory/), and published in [book](https://www.blurb.com/b/9919013-the-art-of-memory) form.

“A locus is a place easily grasped by the memory, such as a house, an intercolumnar space, a corner, an arch, or the like. Images are forms, marks or simulacra (formae, notae, simulacra) of what we wish to remember.”
— Frances Yates, _The Art of Memory_

Pompeii and Catania have been dramatically destroyed by the volcanic eruptions of Mount Vesuvius and Mount Etna respectively: while Pompeii was buried and frozen in time by volcanic ash, Catania was rebuilt time and time again with lava stone.

On the other hand, Poggioreale and Gibellina were smaller hilltowns destroyed by the same 1968 earthquake through the Valle del Belice. While Poggioreale was abandoned as a ghost town, Gibellina was transformed into a major art installation and its occupants relocated to a newly-built modernist dream town, Gibellina Nuova.

### Four Cities, Twelve Sites

_The Art of Memory_ is sited in four Italian towns, all of which have been indelibly changed by natural disasters: Pompeii, Catania, Poggioreale, and Gibellina. Twelve selected sites distill the experience of a twelve-day trip across these towns, presenting documentation, analysis, and interpretation through visual, textual, and digital artifacts.

### Haikus and Drawings

As a way of documenting our twelve-day trip, we each produced twelve drawings and twelve corresponding haikus, one for each day. These twenty-four haikus and drawings capture the immediacy of our travel experience. Short, provocative, and whimsical, these visual and textual reflections are both artifacts from the trip and starting points for further exploration. They have been revised and updated since our return, and are accompanied by twelve maps tracing our daily travel route.

### Flattened Artifacts

In the tradition of gravestone rubbing and surrealist _frottage,_ our thirty rubbings of sites from Sicily to Naples form a catalog of textures, lifted from their context and flattened into the mark-making of drawing.

A form of automatic production, archaeological fragments, and reverse printmaking, these patterns record a physical and geographical displacement from their original sites. They are accompanied by on-site photos and descriptions.

### Speculations

​​​​​​​Drawn after our trip, these six sets of architectural illustrations speculate upon six sites, each representative of a possible future scenario of preservation, rehabilitation, restoration, or reconstruction. How might these complex, historical places age; might they experience a rebirth, or perhaps an afterlife?

{{< figure width="100%" src="/images/portfolio/the-art-of-memory/charisse-foo-the-art-of-memory-17.jpg" >}}

_"**Preservation** focuses on the maintenance and repair of existing historic materials and retention of a property's form as it has evolved over time.
**Rehabilitation** acknowledges the need to alter or add to a historic property to meet continuing or changing uses while retaining the property's historic character.
**Restoration** depicts a property at a particular period of time in its history, while removing evidence of other periods.
**Reconstruction** re-creates vanished or non-surviving portions of a property for interpretive purposes."_

_We would like to thank Cornell AAP for the privilege of the Eidlitz Travel Fellowship, Jeffrey Blanchard and Annalisa Maione from Cornell in Rome for their help with trip planning, as well as Bob Balder and Brooke Moyse at AAP NYC and Kai Alexis Smith at MIT for their indispensable help with our exhibitions. Endless thanks to Onam for plotting for us, and to Inez, Hanxi, Judy, Joyce, and Sam for helping with setting up. A big thank you to Joyce for photographing our opening reception. We extend our heartfelt appreciation to Passage to Sicily, the Poggioreale Antica Association, and our Airbnb hosts, Roberta, Franco, and Carmine, for showing us around their beautiful part of the world. A special thank you to DBOX for supporting Charisse’s extended time off for the trip. We deeply thank our family and friends for their invisible, emotional labor, and for their unending support._
