<p>Charisse graduated with a Bachelor of Architecture (B. Arch) from Cornell University, where
she was awarded the Charles Goodwin Sands Memorial Medal for excellence in her
undergraduate <a href="{% post_url 2017-12-05-the-constructed-ruin %}" class="link">thesis</a>. She started her career as a 3D/CGI artist at <a href="https://dbox.com">DBOX</a> NYC and now works as an architectural designer in Singapore. </p>

<p>She was awarded the 2018-2019 Eidlitz Travel Fellowship for <a href="{% post_url 2019-09-09-the-art-of-memory %}" class="link"><i>The Art of Memory</i></a>, a collaboration with <a href="https://yichenjia.github.io/">Yichen Jia</a>. Her project, <a href="{% post_url 2019-09-17-the-monument-to-the-labors %}" class="link"><i>The Monument to the Labors</i></a>, was awarded first place in the inaugural <a href="https://www.archdaily.com/924961/outer-space-2019-winners-announced">Outer Space</a> (2019) competition.</p>

<p>Charisse is fascinated by the creation of literary and visual worlds, and the potential of fiction
to examine the ethical and the critical realities of architecture. Her recent work explores the
role of time in undermining notions of architectural permanence. She was once described as a
poetic pragmatist, an expression she cherishes to this day.</p>
