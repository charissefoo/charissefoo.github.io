These experiments with Tyflow are by-products of deepening my technical and artistic skills, by learning more about 3D particle systems, physics simulations, and animation. I enrolled in the Tyflow Basecamp in 2020 and thoroughly enjoyed learning and making these.</description></item><item><title>Augmented Heritage Adventure (AHA!)</title><link>http://example.org/blog/augmented-heritage-adventure/</link><pubDate>Sat, 31 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/blog/augmented-heritage-adventure/</guid><description>Magical stories of talking animals, immortals, demons, and deities come to life through augmented reality.

An illustrated journey through time and space, Oasis Waterpark tells of shared memories housed within one public playground. Each moment – joyful, familiar, comforting, playful, or poignant – is framed in a multi-panel comic, charting a narrative that contains the past, present, and future in the same place. This illustration pays homage to Frank King&amp;rsquo;s multi-panel comics of the 1930s, exploring the notion of place, imbued with meaning and memory, through the stories it contains: the structures in which we lose and find ourselves.</description></item><item><title>The Art of Memory</title><link>http://example.org/portfolio/the-art-of-memory/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/portfolio/the-art-of-memory/</guid><description>What does it mean to remember? Sited in four Italian towns that have been indelibly changed by natural disasters, this project explores the notion of architectural memory. Across Pompeii, Catania, Poggioreale, and Gibellina, each town embodies a unique approach towards destruction and preservation. The ‘perfectly’ preserved ruins of Pompeii are set against the bustling capital of Catania, the ghost town of Poggioreale, and the crumbling modernist art installations of Gibellina.</description></item><item><title>Magic Moving Mansion Mania</title><link>http://example.org/portfolio/magic-moving-mansion-mania/</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 May 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/portfolio/magic-moving-mansion-mania/</guid><description>Anastasia is lost in a magical mansion where the rooms move in mysterious ways.
