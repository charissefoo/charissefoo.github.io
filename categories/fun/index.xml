I designed a website for her to consolidate her musical material in one place, and to establish her personal brand.
Context Two barriers had kept Clarisse from making a website: technical knowhow and cost. She didn&amp;rsquo;t code, and she was hesitant about committing to a hefty paid subscription.
I priotized solutions that involved minimal cost, to get her website up and running as soon as possible, and for it to remain a sustainable long-term solution.</description></item><item><title>Tyflow Experiments</title><link>https://charissefoo.github.io/blog/tyflow-experiments/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://charissefoo.github.io/blog/tyflow-experiments/</guid><description>Experiments with 3D Physics and Particle Simulations I&amp;rsquo;d used 3DS Max professionally every day for a couple of years, but still barely scratched the surface of what it could do.
These experiments with Tyflow are by-products of deepening my technical and artistic skills, by learning more about 3D particle systems, physics simulations, and animation. I enrolled in the Tyflow Basecamp in 2020 and thoroughly enjoyed learning and making these.</description></item></channel></rss>
