description: As a multi-disciplinary designer, I have a passion for visual communication and storytelling, be it through a mobile app or a single image. Here's a selection of my work as a visual designer and illustrator, from mobile games to comics, from a travel fellowship with its own exhibition and publication to 3D animations and physics simulations.  My formal training in architecture has instilled in me the ability to design at multiple scales, the love of an iterative and rigorous design process, and the solid technical skills to communicate ideas clearly and persuasively.
