  ### I love making images and telling stories.

  In the last two years, I've read and thought a lot about health, technology, and design.


  It's been a privilege to journey with colleagues and caregivers, and wrestle with questions about life and death, technology and ethics, fear and hope.  
  

  There is nothing else I'd rather do.
