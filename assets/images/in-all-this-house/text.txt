<i>In All This House</i> presents a series of seventeen architectural and narrative drawings about three houses, in a book and exhibition. 

In combining drawing and creative writing, the project asks what it means for architecture to be represented as it is experienced: from the inside out, by the non-architect. Can the act of drawing encompass transcription, translation, and even construction? 

Drawing from the book <i>Let Us Now Praise Famous Men</i> by James Agee and Walker Evans, this project explores the relationship between the written word and the architectural symbol, the book and the building, and the twin creative processes of drawing and writing.

This project was funded in part by a grant from the <a href="http://cca.cornell.edu/" target="_blank">Cornell Council for the Arts (CCA)</a>. It was on display from November 13 - 26, 2017, in Sibley Hall, Cornell University.
