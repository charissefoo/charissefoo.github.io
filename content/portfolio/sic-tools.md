### Overview

Since 2023, I've been a **designer and researcher** at the [Telehealth Core](https://medicine.nus.edu.sg/nuhscg/core-facilities/telehealth-core/about-us/) of the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health at the National University of Singapore.

**The Context:**
- Singapore is set to become a [super-aged society by 2026](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/initiatives-in-place-to-help-tackle-ageing-as-s-pore-nears-super-aged-status-in-2026-ong-ye-kung), with 1 in 5 citizens aged 65 and above.
- The average Singaporean suffers [10 years of ill health](https://www.moh.gov.sg/newsroom/speech-by-mr-ong-ye-kung-minister-for-health-at-the-3rd-centre-for-research-on-successful-ageing-symposium-on-thursday-12-october-2023-945am) before death.
- Healthcare systems and unpaid family caregivers are burdened, with informal caregiving for seniors [valued at S$1.28 billion annually](https://www.duke-nus.edu.sg/newshub/media-coverage/informal-caregiving-for-seniors-valued-at-s1.28-billion-annually).


**The Problem:**

In times of serious illness, informal caregivers are often [unprepared](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35076297/) to make decisions for the patient.

**The Project:** 

[PEACE (Preparing for End-of-Life with Advance Care Education)](https://medicine.nus.edu.sg/nuhscg/telehealth-cores-proposal-for-peace-awarded-3-2m-grant-from-the-nic-grant-call-on-caregiving-ecosystems-careeco/) develops scalable, digital tools to support these caregivers, and better prepare them for discussions with clinicians. 

_The team is starting a randomized controlled trial soon. More updates will be available later._
