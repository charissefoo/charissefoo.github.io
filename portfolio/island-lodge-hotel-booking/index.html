I then sent an <strong>online survey</strong> to hear firsthand about people&rsquo;s experiences with booking hotels. Finally, I conducted <strong>usability tests & interviews</strong> to gain an in-depth understanding of user behaviour, using competitors&rsquo; websites first and my own prototypes later.</p><figure><img src=/images/blog/island-lodge/charisse-foo-island-lodge-hotel-booking-28.jpg width=100%></figure><p>Armed with lots of unstructured data, I used <strong>affinity diagramming</strong> to group my research findings into logical themes.

Hence, tools that helped - such as filters and map views - were very much appreciated.</li><li><strong>Price savings</strong> and flexible cancellation policies were the most important things that users looked for.</li><li><strong>Hidden fees</strong> were by far the most common source of frustration.</li></ol><h3 id=usability-testing>Usability Testing</h3><p>To see how real-life users interacted with existing mobile hotel websites, I conducted a usability test with the Shangri-La Rasa Sentosa website and The Barracks Hotel website. I saw firsthand that <strong>browsing was an important part of the booking process</strong>, as users naturally wanted to see what the hotel had to offer.</p><p><strong>4 Key Takeaways</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Browse first, book later.</strong> The browsing and booking processes should be smoothly connected.</li><li><strong>Pricing structure</strong> needs to be clear and upfront.</li><li><strong>Difficulty in comparing</strong> many different room and payment options leads to frustration.</li><li>Avoid <strong>information overload</strong>: &ldquo;Because there are too many words I’m not going to read.&rdquo;</li></ol><h3 id=analysis>Analysis</h3><p>Affinity diagramming was used to synthesise the findings from all these research methods, generating a <strong>10-step hotel booking sequence</strong> as well as general notes about <strong>best practices, content, and layout.</strong></p><p>Explore the final <a href="https://miro.com/app/live-embed/uXjVO43bKk4=/?moveToViewport=-706,9250,6282,3111&embedId=560986104592">affinity diagram</a> and <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Vpsjww2S982lCD49MGB7uQjW0EuHRlw-/view?usp=sharing">customer journey map</a>. All quotes are directly taken from research participants.</p></details></div><h3 id=5-research-takeaways>5 Research Takeaways</h3><ol><li><p><strong>Breadth first, then depth.</strong> Users would first conduct a broad-based search for hotels with travel aggregators, and then book directly from individual hotel websites. By contacting hotels directly, they hoped to get a better price, the most accurate and updated information, and increased customisation options.</p></li><li><p><strong>Browse first, book later.</strong> Within a single hotel website, users engage in an exploratory browsing process first, finding out what the hotel has to offer, before switching to the linear booking process.</p></li><li><p><strong>No hidden fees.</strong> Hidden fees were repeatedly mentioned as a huge pain point.</p></li><li><p><strong>TL;DR.</strong> Information overload frustrates users and delays decisions, especially when it comes to tbe most crucial point: payment.</p></li><li><p><strong>Is this for real?</strong> Unique to online bookings, users need reassurance that there are real people on the other end. Users want reliable information as well as a personal human touch.</p></li></ol><p>This led to the following 3 design goals:</p><h3 id=-design-goal-increase-clarity>🎯 Design Goal: Increase Clarity</h3><p>TL;DR: Show only the most relevant information. Implement progressive disclosure. Smoothly connect the browsing and booking processes for an intuitive booking experience, leading to better conversion rates.</p><h3 id=-design-goal-increase-transparency>🔎 Design Goal: Increase Transparency</h3><p>Implement price transparency at all times. Automatically calculate and update prices to facilitate user decisions.</p><h3 id=design-goal-increase-trust>🤝Design Goal: Increase Trust</h3><p>Empower users to contact the hotel directly. Reassure visitors with reviews from trusted external sites and a robust social media presence.</p><h3 id=user-flow>User Flow</h3><p>This primary user flow brings users across 10 screens. For users who have concluded their browsing - they enter their dates of travel and select rooms they&rsquo;ve already decided on - this should take no longer than a few minutes.</p><figure><img src=/images/blog/island-lodge/charisse-foo-island-lodge-hotel-booking-04.jpg width=100%></figure><div class=row><div class=col-md>However, some users are not done browsing!
In usability tests, these users explored the different types of rooms and amenities, without bothering to enter any planned dates for travel. To smoothly connect the browsing and booking processes, it was important to enable room selection before date selection as a secondary user flow.</div><div class=col-md><figure><img src=/images/blog/island-lodge/charisse-foo-island-lodge-hotel-booking-05.jpg width=100%></figure></div></div><h3 id=wireframe-sketches>Wireframe Sketches</h3><p>Several important design features were already contained in these sketches:</p><ul><li>a sticky header with constantly updated price and booking information (transparency)</li><li>external reviews (trust)</li><li>concise summaries for each room and payment option (clarity)</li></ul><figure><img src=/images/blog/island-lodge/charisse-foo-island-lodge-hotel-booking-06.jpg width=100%></figure><h3 id=medium-fidelity-prototype--usability-testing>Medium-Fidelity Prototype & Usability Testing</h3><p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Visual content is key</strong>: actual images made it a lot easier for users to interact with the prototype and understand the content that was on the site.

Clicking anywhere in the room title area will bring the user to the individual room page.</p><p><strong>Problem:</strong> It did not make sense to allow a &lsquo;0 Adult&rsquo; or &lsquo;0 Room&rsquo; booking.<br><strong>Response:</strong> When the number of guests or rooms is at a minimum of 1, the &lsquo;-&rsquo; button disappears.</p><figure><img src=/images/blog/island-lodge/charisse-foo-island-lodge-hotel-booking-12.png width=100%></figure><p><strong>Problem:</strong> Users were equally interested in the &lsquo;Sign In&rsquo; or &lsquo;Sign Up&rsquo; options as they were in the &lsquo;Continue as Guest&rsquo; one. Not all requests need follow-up.<br><strong>Response:</strong> Buttons were standardised in size and alignment, allowing for greater visual consistency. The line about necessary follow-up was removed.</p><p><strong>Problem:</strong> Making the &lsquo;Sign In&rsquo; screen an overlay over the previous screen increased visual clutter. There was potential confusion regarding the grayed-out back button.<br><strong>Response:</strong> The &lsquo;Sign In&rsquo; screen is its own screen, and the page title and back button are consistent across all screens.</p><figure><img src=/images/blog/island-lodge/charisse-foo-island-lodge-hotel-booking-13.png width=100%></figure><p><strong>Problem:</strong> A summary of the booking details should be presented legibly, with details such as a price breakdown and reservation number.<br><strong>Response:</strong> More information was added and differentiated through visual hierarchy.</p><h3 id=visual-design>Visual Design</h3><figure><img src=/images/blog/island-lodge/charisse-foo-island-lodge-hotel-booking-14.jpg width=100%></figure><p><strong>Mood images</strong> provided inspiration for the visual design. Since <em>The Island Lodge</em> is a high-end beach resort, I went for <strong>warm earthy tones,</strong> a primarily <strong>dark, muted palette</strong>, and serif headings to convey a sense of <strong>timeless tropical luxury.</strong></p><p>In this style guide for typography and colour, the dark primary green evokes <strong>lush tropical vegetation</strong>. The light colours are used for pages with <strong>specific microtasks</strong>, such as date selection, before the user returns to the darker <strong>&lsquo;home&rsquo; colour palette.</strong></p><figure><img src=/images/blog/island-lodge/charisse-foo-island-lodge-hotel-booking-15.jpg width=100%></figure><p>Knowing that yellow and green are a common set of confusion colours when it comes to colour blindness, I <a href=https://davidmathlogic.com/colorblind>tested</a> the colour scheme for <strong>accessibility to people with colour blindness</strong> and made adjustments.<figure><img src=/images/blog/island-lodge/charisse-foo-island-lodge-hotel-booking-16.jpg width=100%></figure></p><h3 id=high-fidelity-prototype>High Fidelity Prototype</h3><figure><img src=/images/blog/island-lodge/charisse-foo-island-lodge-hotel-booking-10.jpg width=100%></figure><p>These wirefames are the basis for the high fidelity prototype shown at the start. Besides improvements to copy and content, I designed additional screens to facilitate the <strong>secondary user flow</strong> where room selection occurs before date selection. Designs for <strong>error states</strong> are also included.</p><h4 id=design-iterations-1>Design Iterations</h4><figure><img src=/images/blog/island-lodge/charisse-foo-island-lodge-hotel-booking-17.png width=100%></figure><p>As <strong>price transparency is very important to users</strong>, and there is a lot of information presented, I expanded the price breakdown screen from a modal dropdown to a separate page.</p><figure><img src=/images/blog/island-lodge/charisse-foo-island-lodge-hotel-booking-18.png width=100%></figure><p>Similarly, I split the final success screen into two, to properly <strong>congratulate</strong> the user for completing the booking process with a splash image, and give the <strong>all-important booking details sufficient space</strong> on a separate page. The &lsquo;Back to Home&rsquo; button was also replaced with <strong>more useful functions</strong> of <strong>editing</strong> the reservation or <strong>sharing</strong> the trip with friends and family.</p><h3 id=design-annotations>Design Annotations</h3><figure><img src=/images/blog/island-lodge/charisse-foo-island-lodge-hotel-booking-19.jpg width=100%></figure><p>To wrap up the design process, I produced these design annotations as <strong>handover documentation</strong> for developers to build the website accurately. The full 18-page document can be found <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZkRj5t5BSqYcLx8gPDEsAxVvdqbTjg45/view?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p><figure><img src=/images/blog/island-lodge/charisse-foo-island-lodge-hotel-booking-21.jpg width=100%></figure><h3 id=design-feedback>Design Feedback</h3><p>&ldquo;The prototype functions very well, it was easy to get through, easy to understand and very pleasant to look at.&rdquo;</p><h3 id=further-exploration>Further Exploration</h3><p>As this was an academic project, a significant next step would be to <strong>integrate real-world hotel information</strong>, which often has a much higher level of complexity: many more details regarding payment, hotel policies, terms and conditions, health and security regulations, just to name a few. Working with a client with an existing repository of information to be presented would add complexity to the design process.</p><p>Since I chose to focus on a mobile website, a separate <strong>desktop version</strong> would also have to be designed. I&rsquo;d also sketched out a <strong>comparison feature</strong> for different payment options if the hotel absolutely needed to offer many different options.</p><p>To further expand the scope of this project, I&rsquo;d integrate this particular hotel into a <strong>larger hotel group</strong>, which manages several hotels across different locations. This is often the case with large hotel brands such as Four Seasons or Shangri-La. Each hotel would have its own identity, but be linked to the larger brand ecosystem. I&rsquo;d expect this to make the booking process more exploratory and complex, with greater importance placed on <strong>brand loyalty and membership privileges.</strong></p><figure><img src=/images/blog/island-lodge/charisse-foo-island-lodge-hotel-booking-23.jpg width=100%></figure><h3 id=learning-points>Learning Points</h3><p>Going through <strong>the entire UX process from research to analysis to design</strong> was highly enriching and educational. I especially appreciated the insights gained through usability testing - <strong>nothing challenges or validates a design as much as seeing someone completely unfamiliar with it interact with it for the first time.</strong></p><p>Technically, I <strong>thoroughly enjoyed learning Figma</strong> from scratch through this project. I&rsquo;d like to delve deeper into user interface design with grid systems for screens that are <strong>pixel-perfect</strong>, and visual design by developing a <strong>strong brand identity.</strong></p></div></div></div></div><div class=singleBlog__content><div class="row mt-5"><div class="col-lg-10 offset-lg-1"><nav class="case-details-nav d-flex justify-content-between align-items-center"><div class="previous d-flex align-items-center"><div class="icon mr-3"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15.556" height="28.285" viewBox="0 0 15.556 28.285"><g data-name="Group 1243" fill="#2d2d2d"><path data-name="Path 1456" d="M3.391 12.728l9.75 14.142-.982 1.414-9.742-14.142z"/><path data-name="Path 1455" d="M13.137 1.41 3.39 15.558l-.975-1.415L12.166.0z"/></g></svg></div><div class=content><span class=small>Previous Project</span><h5 class=title><a class=text-dark href=https://charissefoo.github.io/portfolio/magic-moving-mansion-mania/>Magic Moving Mansion Mania</a></h5></div></div><div class="next d-flex align-items-center"><div class="content text-right"><span class=small>Next Project</span><h5 class=title><a class=text-dark href=https://charissefoo.github.io/portfolio/jewellery-ecommerce/>Jewellery Ecommerce on Mobile</a></h5></div><div class="icon ml-3"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="15.556" height="28.285" viewBox="0 0 15.556 28.285"><g data-name="Group 1244" fill="#2d2d2d"><path data-name="Path 1456" d="M12.162 12.725 2.416 26.87l.978 1.41 9.746-14.138z"/><path data-name="Path 1455" d="M2.416 1.415l9.743 14.141.975-1.414L3.39.0z"/></g></svg></div></div></nav></div></div></div></section></div><section class=footer><div class=container><div class="row footer__footer"><div class=col-lg-6><div class="footer__footer_copy text-light"><p>If you made it this far, <a href=https://charissefoo.github.io/contact>let's talk.</a></p></div><div class=footer__footer_copy><p class=text-light>© Charisse Foo</p></div></div><div class=col-lg-6><div class=footer__footer_social><ul class=unstyle-list><li class="d-inline-block mx-2"><a class=text-light target=_blank href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/charissefoo><i class="fa fa-linkedin-square"></i></a></li><li class="d-inline-block mx-2"><a class=text-light target=_blank href=https://www.behance.net/charissefoo><i class="fa fa-behance-square"></i></a></li><li class="d-inline-block mx-2"><a class=text-light target=_blank href=https://instagram.com/charissefoo><i class="fa fa-instagram"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></section><script src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=YOUR%20GOOGLE%20MAP%20API&libraries=geometry"></script>
