In recent years, conversations with my junior college art teacher about art education and the role of technology in art-making led to some realisations:
3D software is largely absent from the art curriculum. Teachers aren&amp;rsquo;t really familiar with 3D software or what it can do. Some students pick up Blender by themselves and make artwork despite a steep learning curve.</description></item><item><title>Tyflow Experiments</title><link>http://example.org/blog/tyflow-experiments/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/blog/tyflow-experiments/</guid><description>Experiments with 3D Physics and Particle Simulations I&amp;rsquo;d used 3DS Max professionally every day for a couple of years, but still barely scratched the surface of what it could do.
These experiments with Tyflow are by-products of deepening my technical and artistic skills, by learning more about 3D particle systems, physics simulations, and animation. I enrolled in the Tyflow Basecamp in 2020 and thoroughly enjoyed learning and making these.</description></item></channel></rss>
