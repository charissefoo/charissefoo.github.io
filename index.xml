Outcome Magic Moving Mansion Mania is a mobile action-puzzle-platformer for iOS and Android. It was conceptualised and created in four months under the Game Design Initiative at Cornell (GDIAC).</description></item><item><title>Establishing a Classical Pianist's Online Presence</title><link>https://charissefoo.github.io/portfolio/pianist-website/</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://charissefoo.github.io/portfolio/pianist-website/</guid><description>Overview My client, a classical pianist, wanted to establish her personal brand online.
I helped consolidate all her musical material in a website, which she would be able to manage herself using an intuitive, no-code editor. I also conducted a photoshoot with her to create essential visual content for her site.
Context Even with her professional social media accounts, YouTube channel, and Spotify artist page, there was no single platform with a holistic overview of Clarisse&amp;rsquo;s practice as a classical pianist.</description></item><item><title>My Generated Valentine</title><link>https://charissefoo.github.io/blog/my-generated-valentine/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://charissefoo.github.io/blog/my-generated-valentine/</guid><description>Writing poetry with Tracery, a text-generation JS library I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with Tracery recently: it&amp;rsquo;s a perfect casual creator tool, easy to pick up, simple, and powerful. I figured a valentine generator would be a fun little project, so I scribbled out some sentences one day, while procrastinating over something else.

How it all began More than a decade ago, I chose to take Art as an A-Level subject.
In recent years, conversations with my junior college art teacher about art education and the role of technology in art-making led to some realisations:
3D software is largely absent from the art curriculum.</description></item><item><title>SketchUp for Architecture</title><link>https://charissefoo.github.io/blog/sketchup-for-architecture/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://charissefoo.github.io/blog/sketchup-for-architecture/</guid><description>A knowledge base for architects. Check it out here!
Why? SketchUp for Architecture was born from a desire to share knowledge.
It was started over a weekend while I was working full-time at an architectural office. With varying levels of experience within the firm, there was a great opportunity to share and establish best practices, streamline modelling processes, and essentially improve internal workflow for the team.
Architects do a lot.</description></item><item><title>Tyflow Experiments</title><link>https://charissefoo.github.io/blog/tyflow-experiments/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://charissefoo.github.io/blog/tyflow-experiments/</guid><description>Experiments with 3D Physics and Particle Simulations I&amp;rsquo;d used 3DS Max professionally every day for a couple of years, but still barely scratched the surface of what it could do.
These experiments with Tyflow are by-products of deepening my technical and artistic skills, by learning more about 3D particle systems, physics simulations, and animation. I enrolled in the Tyflow Basecamp in 2020 and thoroughly enjoyed learning and making these.</description></item><item><title>Augmented Heritage Adventure (AHA!)</title><link>https://charissefoo.github.io/blog/augmented-heritage-adventure/</link><pubDate>Sat, 31 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://charissefoo.github.io/blog/augmented-heritage-adventure/</guid><description>Magical stories of talking animals, immortals, demons, and deities come to life through augmented reality. AHA! (Augmented Heritage Adventure) revives the famed Qing Dynasty work of Zichuan-born writer Pu Songling: Liaozhai Zhiyi (ËÅäÊñãÂøóÂºÇ), known in English as Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio. Pu Songling‚Äôs residence in Zichuan has been preserved as a tourist attraction, and now his five hundred fantastic tales find new life in a gamified augmented reality adventure.</description></item><item><title>Oasis Waterpark</title><link>https://charissefoo.github.io/blog/oasis-waterpark/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://charissefoo.github.io/blog/oasis-waterpark/</guid><description>Oasis Waterpark explores architectural memory through comics. An illustrated journey through time and space, Oasis Waterpark tells of shared memories housed within one public playground. Each moment ‚Äì joyful, familiar, comforting, playful, or poignant ‚Äì is framed in a multi-panel comic, charting a narrative that contains the past, present, and future in the same place. This illustration pays homage to Frank King&amp;rsquo;s multi-panel comics of the 1930s, exploring the notion of place, imbued with meaning and memory, through the stories it contains: the structures in which we lose and find ourselves.</description></item><item><title>Satellite Town</title><link>https://charissefoo.github.io/blog/satellite-town/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://charissefoo.github.io/blog/satellite-town/</guid><description>Satellite Town illustrates a future of ecological living beyond the limits of the Earth. In a research community living in a satellite orbiting the Moon, distinct notions of self-sufficiency and sustainability are explored, each with a distinct color palette. The Forest depicts the distinctive pink glow of high intensity LEDs for crop growth; The Street imagines an underpass with bioluminescent mycelium pavements that generate electricity from footsteps; The Chapel depicts a zero-gravity projection room featuring an endless sunset against distant planets.</description></item><item><title>The Monument to the Labors</title><link>https://charissefoo.github.io/blog/the-monument-to-the-labors/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://charissefoo.github.io/blog/the-monument-to-the-labors/</guid><description>The Monument to the Labors tells an architectural fable in outer space. Narrated dispassionately, The Monument to the Labors imagines a future that has already been translated into history. In this recasting of the pioneer narrative, the first settlers of space are not merely brave explorers but also condemned convicts. Centering around alienation and the implications of denying humanity to the other, the story simultaneously charts the lifespan of a building: a satellite, prison, laboratory, factory, town, tomb, billboard, attraction, and symbol.</description></item><item><title>The Art of Memory</title><link>https://charissefoo.github.io/blog/the-art-of-memory/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://charissefoo.github.io/blog/the-art-of-memory/</guid><description>Overview Historic preservation is often a dry topic, with a large focus on regulations and conservation. Here, we take an experimental approach towards preservation, investigating architectural memory through travel, documentation, and speculative drawings.
The Art of Memory was a collaboration with Yichen Jia, made possible by the 2018-2019 Robert James Eidlitz Travel Fellowship. It was exhibited in NYC and MIT, and published in book form.

An ethereal presence, Fluid Pavilion displays the ability of plastic to be both rigid and organic, with the lightness of a transparent enclosure. Built upon spatial, material, and visual deformations, the pavilion is both clear and hazy, open and closed: as much a window frame as it is a wall.
Fluid Pavilion was a collaboration with Hanxi Wang, with the mentorship of Sasa Zivkovic and Martin Miller, Cornell University.</description></item></channel></rss>
