### Overview

As part of my [Professional Diploma in UX Design](https://www.credential.net/358581c5-0f90-41d7-9301-82ff6f7b1d3e#gs.9pjyb3), I designed a **mobile website** focusing on the **hotel booking process**.

Before designing, I conducted research about the **hotel booking process on mobile**.

### Research Methods

Research methods include:

- **competitive analysis**
- **online survey**
- **usability tests**
- **interviews**

Findings were synthesised through **affinity diagramming** and presented in a **customer journey map.**

_For the design outcome, please refer to [The Island Lodge Hotel Booking case study]({{< ref "/portfolio/island-lodge-hotel-booking" >}} "Case Study")._

### Online Survey

To understand users' **goals, behaviours, and pain points** regarding the online hotel booking process, I conducted an online survey with family and friends.

This was a valuable source of insights. The full report on the survey results can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZnYSxx7rKj85M2YH8atA11291HplnCwG/view?usp=sharing).

#### Key Takeaways

1. The online booking process can be split into four distinct stages: **Research, Comparison, Investigation, and Booking.** Users conduct **initial breadth-based research** with a search engine like Google or a travel aggregator, compare and investigate options, and finally **book a hotel, often through its own specific site.**
2. **Finding and comparing options** were the most time-consuming processes. Hence, tools that helped (eg. filters, map view) were very much appreciated.
3. **Price savings** and **flexible/free cancellation policies** were the most important things that users looked for.
4. **Hidden fees** were by far the most common source of frustration.

### Competitive Analysis

Time to get more specific: I was designing the website of a **luxury beachfront hotel** located St John's Island, Singapore. Its closest competitors are hotels located on the touristic holiday island of Sentosa, which offers a myriad of high-end hotels, resorts, and holiday programmes. To find out **established conventions, best practices, as well as mistakes to avoid**, I looked at the mobile websites of four hotels in Sentosa - The Shangri-La Rasa Sentosa, The Barracks Hotel, Amara Resort Sanctuary, and Capella Singapore - with a particular focus on their hotel booking process.

A 25-page document containing the full analysis of the first two hotels can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1b8cNt9pz8RjQ-1LR0NlJx7pETGtAH0IV/view?usp=sharing).

#### Best Practices

1. Constant display of price thus far incurred establishes **price transparency**
2. Microtasks such as date selection are on **separate modal pages** with nothing else to distract users' focus
3. **Filters** for room selection mitigate an overwhelming number of options
4. **Collapsible sections** save screen space and implement **progressive disclosure**

#### Learning Points

1. Establish **visual hierarchy** and maintain consistent typography and formatting
2. All images should be **optimised for mobile**
3. Text should be **concise**, especially with limited screen space on mobile
4. **Labels (text and icons) should be tested** to ensure they make sense to users
5. **Avoid an overwhelming number of options** that are not significantly different from each other

### Usability Testing

To see how real-life users interacted with existing mobile hotel websites, I conducted a usability test with the Shangri-La Rasa Sentosa website and The Barracks Hotel website. I saw firsthand that **browsing was an important part of the booking process**, as users naturally wanted to see what the hotel had to offer.

#### Key Takeaways

1. **Browse first, book later.** The browsing and booking processes should be smoothly connected.
2. **Date selection** usually occurs before **room selection**, but this can be reversed.
3. **Pricing structure** needs to be clear and upfront.
4. **Difficulty in comparing** many different room and payment options leads to frustration.
5. Avoid **information overload.** A direct quote: "Because there are too many words Iâ€™m not going to read."

### Analysis

Affinity diagramming was used to synthesise the findings from all these research methods, generating a **10-step hotel booking sequence** as well as general notes about **best practices, content, and layout.**

### Customer Journey Map

The affinity diagram results were then translated into a customer journey map about the hotel booking process. All quotes are directly taken from research participants.

### Research Summary

1. **Breadth first, then depth.** Users would first conduct a broad-based search for hotels with travel aggregators, and then book directly from individual hotel websites. By contacting hotels directly, they hoped to get a better price, the most accurate and updated information, and increased customisation options.

2. **Browse first, book later.** Within a single hotel website, users engage in an exploratory browsing process first, finding out what the hotel has to offer, before switching to the linear booking process.

3. **No hidden fees.** Hidden fees were repeatedly mentioned as a huge pain point.

4. **TL;DR.** Information overload frustrates users and delays decisions, especially when it comes to tbe most crucial point: payment.

### Design Approaches

These research insights lent themselves to several key design approaches:

1. I chose to design an **individual hotel website**, focusing on the later part of the hotel booking process.
2. Smoothly connecting the **browsing and booking processes** within a hotel website is important to increase user satisfaction as well as conversion rates.
3. **Price transparency** should be implemented throughout the booking process, prices should be displayed upfront.
4. Only the most relevant information should be shown, and **progressive disclosure** implemented to increase comprehension and scannability.
